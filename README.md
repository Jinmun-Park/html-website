wors with others and improve my html/css coding skills. I personally enjoy alot in decorating my websit and i am happy to see the result after changes.</p>

## Website
I am using netlify for my domain and Continuous Deployment. I have not registered for my own domain till i am satisfied with the general layout in website.
The general structure is copied from the free HTML website and i added several functions my own to improve it better.

1. Please check out my website : [JinmunPark][netlify]
2. Free HTML Template : [FreeCssTemplate][freecss]

1. Portfolio and job recruitment
